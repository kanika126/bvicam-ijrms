        Plagiarism is the unethical act of copying someone else’s prior ideas, processes, results or words without explicit acknowledgement of the original author and source. Self-plagiarism occurs when an author utilizes large part of his/her own previously published work without using appropriate references. This can range from getting the same manuscript published in multiple conferences / journals to modifying a previously published manuscript with some new data.

International Journal of Research in Multidisciplinary Studies (IJRMS) is a bi-annual peer-reviewed referred research journal of Bharati Vidyapeeth’s Institute of Computer Applications and Management (BVICAM), New Delhi. The Journal aims to bring authors from various disciples on a single platform to showcase their knowledge. The multidisciplinary can also be seen in single research paper where various data and features related to bioinformatics, health, traffic, weather etc. could be analyzed using computer science. The Journal has attracted eminent academicians, scientists, researchers, industrialists, technocrats, government representatives, social visionaries and experts from all strata of society, to explore the new horizons of innovations to identify opportunities and define the path forward.
<br></br><br></br>
The IJRMS journal is strictly against any unethical act of copying or plagiarism in any form. Plagiarism is said to have occurred when large portions of a manuscript have been copied from existing previously published resources. All manuscripts submitted to IJRMS are cross-checked for plagiarism using Turnitin software. Manuscripts found to be plagiarized during initial stages of review are out-rightly rejected and not considered for Journal publications.
<br></br><br></br>
In case a manuscript is found to be plagiarized after publication, the Editor-in-Chief will conduct preliminary investigation, may be with the help of a suitable committee constituted for the purpose. If the manuscript is found to be plagiarized beyond the acceptable limits, the IJRMS Team will contact the author’s Institute / College / University and Funding Agency, if any. A determination of misconduct will lead IJRMS to run a statement bi-directionally linked online to and from the original paper, to note the plagiarism and provide a reference to the plagiarized material. The paper containing the plagiarism will also be marked on each page of the PDF. Upon determination of the extent of plagiarism, the paper may also be formally retracted.

TYPES OF PLAGIARISM
<br></br>
The following types of plagiarism are considered by IJRMS:-
<br></br>
1. Full Plagiarism: Previously published content without any changes to the text, idea and grammar is considered as full plagiarism. It involves presenting exact text from a source as one’s own.<br></br>
2. Partial Plagiarism: If content is a mixture from multiple different sources, where the author has extensively rephrased text, then it is known as partial plagiarism.
3. Self-Plagiarism: When an author reuses complete or portions of their pre-published research, then it is known as self-plagiarism. Complete self-plagiarism is a case when an author republishes their own previously published work in a new conference / journal.<br></br><br></br>
